 *
 * The projects in this directory comprise the MultiSpecies Surplus Production Model
 * application. This application allows the user to create their own Model by specifying a
 * unique combination of 4 forms: Growth, Harvest, Competition, and Predation. The user
 * then estimates the desired parameters by selecting from various parameter estimation
 * algorithms. In addition to parameter estimation, the user may run diagnostics and
 * build forecasts. Forecasts may be aggregated in Scenario plots for comparative analysis.
