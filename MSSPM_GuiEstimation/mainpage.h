 *
 * The classes in this package define GUI forms available to the user for data input. In addition
 * to data input, they allow the user to select the type of estimation desired from various
 * algorithms and sub-algorithms, along with their associated parameters. Finally, the user runs
 * the estimation from the final GUI, having output automatically directed to other GUIs in the
 * application.
